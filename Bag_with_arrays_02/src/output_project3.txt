RUNNING TEST CASES
Created bag1:
There are 5 element(s): C A A A X
Created bag2:
The bag is empty
After removing the last element X from bag1, it contains:
There are 4 element(s): C A A A

***Testing equals method***
Are bag1 and bag2 equal? --> NO
Are bag2 and bag1 equal? --> NO
bag2:
There are 5 element(s): A A A C X
Are bag1 and bag2 equal? --> NO
Removed X from bag2:
There are 4 element(s): A A A C
Are bag1 and bag2 equal now? --> NO
Created bagCopyOfBag1:
There are 4 element(s): C A A A
Are bag1 and bagCopyOfBag1 equal? --> YES

***Testing union, intersection, difference, removeMax, getAllLessThan and isSubset methods***
bag1:
There are 5 element(s): C A A X A
bag2:
There are 7 element(s): A B B A C C D

***Testing union method***
The union of bag1 and bag2 is:
There are 12 element(s): C A A X A A B B A C C D

***Testing removeMax method***
Removed the largest element "X" from the union bag; the current content is:
There are 11 element(s): C A A D A A B B A C C
The bag is empty and removeMax returned null - CORRECT

***Testing intersection method***
The intersection of bag1 and bag2 is:
There are 3 element(s): C A A

***Testing difference method***
The difference of bag1 and bag2 is:
There are 2 element(s): A X
The difference of bag2 and bag1 is:
There are 4 element(s): C B B D

***Testing getAllLessThan method***
The following entries in bag1 are smaller than "Z":
There are 5 element(s): C A A X A
The following entries in bag2 are smaller than "C":
There are 4 element(s): A B B A

***Testing isSubset method***
Is bag1 a subset of bag1 ? --> YES
Is bag1 a subset of bag2 ? --> NO
Is an empty bag a subset of bag2 ? --> YES
Is bag2 a subset of an empty bag ? --> NO
Created bag3:
There are 3 element(s): A B C
Created bag4:
There are 3 element(s): B C A
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 ? --> YES
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 after adding "Z" to it ? --> YES
Is bag4 a subset of bag3 ? --> NO
Adding  "Z" to bag 3 twice
bag3:
There are 5 element(s): A B C Z Z
bag4:
There are 4 element(s): B C A Z
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 ? --> NO

***Testing replace method***
bag1:
There are 7 element(s): A A B X A C A
Replaced "A" with "X"
Now bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): A A B X A C X

***Testing removeEvery method***
bag1:
There are 7 element(s): A A B X A C X
Removing all "Z"
After removing all "Z" bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): A A B X A C X
Removing all "A"
After removing all "A" bag1 contains:
There are 4 element(s): X C B X
Removing all "X"
After removing all "X" bag1 contains:
There are 2 element(s): B C

Process finished with exit code 0
