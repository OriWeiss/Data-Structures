decimal to binary
    while > 0
        create variable a
        create variable b
        b = a%2
        a = a/2
        push b to stack


ancientMultiplier
    create 2 stacks
    start with smaller factor
    while the peek of the stack is > larger stack multiple
        push 2x the peek output of each stack
    output sum of smaller stack

noAdjacentDuplicate
    for every # given
        check state
            empty
                push
            not empty
                check top of state if duplicate
                true

                pop the top
            false
                nothing




Sort
    create two stacks
    start with all elements in one stack
    pop the first element and move to next stack
    use peek to copare two stacks
        while
            if original stack is less than new stack
                pop and push to new stack
            else
                pop the new stack and place card in original stack at bottom of new stack

sortRevised
    create two stacks
    move the top entry of original stack to destination stack
    compare the top entries
        while original stack !isEmpty
            if original>destination
                pop and push to destination
            else
                pop and push to original
