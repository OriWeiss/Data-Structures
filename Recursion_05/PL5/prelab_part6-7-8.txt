PART 6
345 to base 8

base case: if decimal number being converted = 0
             do nothing (or return "")

Recursive case: if decimal number being converted > 0
                    number/8
                    solve a simpler version of the problem by using the quotient as the argument to the next call
                    store the current remainder (number % 8) in the correct place

345 to base 2

base case: if decimal number being converted = 0
             do nothing (or return "")

Recursive case: if decimal number being converted > 0
                    number/2
                    use the quotient as the argument to the next call
                    store the current remainder (number % 2) in the correct place



PART 7

one argument must be taken in number of spots

base case: slots are are filled with 1

Recursive case: add one to the next spot
                if spot on left has one
                    reset and keep a one at next spot without changing

PART 8

base case: no more numbers

Recursive case: if number is even do not count middle number
                take the amount of number and divide by 2
                find the position of the number you're checking
                start with -1 index of that number and compare
                as you move down the line increment -1 index by -1 each time you move
